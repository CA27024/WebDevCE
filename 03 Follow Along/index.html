    <h1> Declaration of Independance</h1>
    <h2>What it says</h2>
    <p>We hold these truths to be <strong>self-evident</strong>, that all men are <em>created equal</em>, that they are
      endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
      Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
      consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right
      of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles
      and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
    </p>
    <p>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in
      direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to
      a candid world.</p>

    <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. </li>
      <li> He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
        operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
      </li>
    </ol>
