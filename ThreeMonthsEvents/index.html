            I ate some tuna
        </h3>

        <p>
            I got some tuna from the store and added mustard/mayo and then ate it with chips. It was 10/10 in the moment <br>
            but in retrospect it was probably a 7/10. Overall though some delicious tuna.

        <p>
            I ate food because if I didn't I would die. I also drank water for the same reason.
